We use number of executed lines as an approximation for the
run time analysis, as shown in the videos of the course.

Task 0

Setting variables and accessing elements in a list have constant time complexity in python.
Since this is all we do in this task the time complexity of Task 0 is O(1).

Task 1

In this task we iterate through all elements of the texts and calls files and then
do constant operations inside it, like accessing an element and adding it to a set.

So the time complexity of Task 1 is O(n+m) where

n = number of records in texts file
m = number of records in calls file

Task 2

n = number of records in calls file

In this task we iterate through all calls. Inside the loop we do constant operations
like accessing elements in a list, checking if a dictionary key exists, adding keys
to a dictionary and adding a number to its value. So the time complexity for the
loop is O(n).

After that we search for the maximum duration, which has the time complexity O(2n) in
the worst case where every incoming and answering number in the calls file is unique.

After that we search for the index of the maximum duration using duration.index()
which also has a time complexity of O(2n)

Hence, all operations in this task are linear so we could approximate the time
complexity of Task 2 as being O(n)
